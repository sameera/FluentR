# FluentR: Extension methods of DotNext Result<T>

FluentR is a collection of Extension Methods helping you to write Functional Programming sytle C# code.
This library was inspired by my earlier work for [Outcome<T>](https://github.com/sameera/Codoxide.Outcome)
which was extensively used in production by one my prior product teams. While `Outcome<T>` was a standalone 
library, **FluentR** is meant to be used with [DotNext Result<T>](https://dotnet.github.io/dotNext/api/DotNext.Result-1.html).
